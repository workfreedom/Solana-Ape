## ✏️ Setup Guide
You need to edit the **config.js** file to change the solana receiver wallet.

- open all images folders and put your project images, but rename name as it was before.
- open index.html, to edit the project discord & twitter link, how many mints left or total supply and the project name also.

After it, you're done. You only need to host the website into Netlify for example or Hostinger
